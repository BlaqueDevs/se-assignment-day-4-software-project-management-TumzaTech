## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall is like following instructions step-by-step: good for knowing exactly what you'll get, but hard to change. Agile is like building a bit, then changing it: flexible and good for trying new things, but harder to predict the final result. Waterfall is like a race with checkpoints, Agile is like exploring a maze.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Good for projects that might change, like building a new app.
Waterfall: Good for projects that need a strict plan, like building medical software
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?Methods for quality: Testing, code reviews, and checklists.
Methods for quality: Testing, code reviews, and checklists.
Why it's important: Happy users, safety, and a good reputation.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project Scope: It's like drawing a line around what your project will include, so you don't try to do too much. It helps you know exactly what you're building.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): It's like making a list of all the small tasks you need to do to finish your project. It helps you organize your work and make sure you don't forget anything.

They help you see how long each task will take and if any tasks depend on each other.   
They make it easy to see if the project is on track.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
